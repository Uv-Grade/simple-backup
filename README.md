# The EASIEST Tool for Backup/File Sync for Mac/PC/Linux

The JSON config file is used to store the directories where you are backing up to "destination" and the locations you are backing up from "sources". This tool is essentially for maintaining a synchronization of your files on a backup drive, much cleaner than using the OS's built in tools. Useful for when you have many different local directories you want backed up on your local machine.
For Windows users, the PowerShell script uses this JSON file to iterate through a RoboCopy command.
For Mac and Linux users, the Python script uses this JSON file to iterate through an rsync command.

Right now, I'm just struggling to get a proper runnable JAR file on any platform. But the concept is there, I will upload a YouTube video explaining how it works soon.
